title: What should I do during the Pandemic
---

- First and foremost: Do not panic
- Follow Covid behavior, which has been told repeatedly Viz.
  - Social Distancing
  - Avoid unnecessary outing
  - Mask
  - Frequent had wash with soap and water

## Am I suffering from Corona?

- Body ache, weakness + mild fever are earliest symptoms
- Cough and cold
- Some also have diarrhoea
- If these persist beyond 3 days and/or associated with fever &gt; 100 F get RT PCR done

## Why not Immediately?

- Mild body ache, lasting for 2-3 hours disappearing by itself is more likely to be due to non Covid viral fever
- If you test very early it may not come positive despite having disease.

## During Home isolation

- Contact physician and start medication
- Rest
- Monitor and record Pulse/Temperature/SPO2 every 4 hours
- Steam inhalation

Monitoring is very important because in some people especially young even SPO2 falls patient feels comfortable

Contact doctor if:

- Fever persist &gt;100 degree F
- Breathing difficulty
- SPO2 &lt; 94%

## Extreme Covid Behavior
- Panic with minimum symptoms
- I am young my symptoms are mild
- Collecting and Hoarding medicines
- My parents/beloved will worry
- Getting admitted in hospital because I can afford

More than 90 % patients recover well with timely treatment

## If someone is Covid positive in house

- Keep him well isolated
- Do not share his/her toilet
- If only toilet in house do not use for 20 minutes after the positive person uses it
- Wear mask always
- Other members of household should be watchful about symptoms in themself, and follow protocol as above
- Even if no symptoms appear for 7-8 days, stay away from others till then

## If I get Covid infection during pregnancy

- Unlike last year this second wave this second wave is affecting many pregnant women.
- Treatment for Covid is same as that of a non-pregnant patient, except that certain medicines are not advisable during pregnancy.
- Ivermectin and Doxycycline should be avoided during pregnancy.
- Aspirin, heparin should be stopped at least one week before delivery. Therefor stop these 3 to 4 week before EDD.
- CT scan can be done if essential
- Antiviral drugs should be given when absolutely essential for patients recovery.
- It is better that a physician treats a pregnant Covid patient then a obstetrician

## Word of advice

Unfortunately something goes wrong in family, do not blame doctor convince yourself that t/system/government/your country or yourself. Do not try to convince yourself that this mishap was preventable, and it occurred because someone did something wrong.

Most of medicines reduce severity of disease reduce hospital stay but not mortality by a significant extent. Early diagnosis and early treatment is key to get well.

## Tsunami of second wave and what I can do to minimize further damage

Although anticipated to some extent, all of us collectively failed to anticipate severity of second wave. We behaved well during first year and gradual unlock was done after Diwali. Beyond a small spike in November surprisingly the number of affected cases kept on falling till February this year. So we thought we won and removed our guard.

Virus is very weak and vulnerable without a host. But it very fast propagated inside a host, also it can mutate and exhibit new characteristics. In a gathering it finds new host and spreads.

We are fortunate that vaccination of healthcare workers and other frontline workers was complete before second wave struck a t least we have people working in hospitals. This in turn proves that vaccine works. So keep in mind that vaccine is an important weapon in our hand to fight corona.

## Why do people try to avoid Vaccination

- Some think they will get Covid after vaccination. In fact immunity develops after 3 weeks of second dose, if someone gets disease before it isn't because of the vaccine but despite the vaccine.
- Some are worried about side effects. Every medicine has some or other side effects, but with vaccine it is very low and risk of Covid is far more than risk of side effect of vaccine.
- I may miss my important work e.g. examination etc. if I get vaccine now. Side effect if at all they occur like body ache mild fever that it is not likely to make you miss your work and again risk of disease far more to make you miss your important work.

## Some other aspect of vaccine

**Q :- If I am positive when should I get vaccine?**<br/>
A:- After 8 to 12 week of positive report


**Q:- Should I get vaccine during periods?**<br/>
A:- Yes


**Q:- Can I get vaccine if I am pregnant or breast feeding baby?**<br/>
A:- International society of Obstetricians recommend that it can be done during pregnancy and lactation. In India vaccination is not recommended for pregnant woman, there is no clear guideline regarding lactation. We all are learning, I would recommend avoid vaccine for 6 to 8 weeks after delivery, till you are fully active
