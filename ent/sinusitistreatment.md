**Acute sinusitis** is treated by drugs, which are:

- Antibiotics
- Pain killers
- Decongestants ( Drugs which decrease congestion and discharge, by decreasing the fluid secretion by sinus and nasal mucosa. )  These Decongestants are given  Locally (e.g. Sprays ) and Systemic (e.g. Tablets, Syrups )
- Steam Inhalation, optionally with Tincture Benzoin is also used for its decongestant effect.

**Chronic sinusitis** is treated Surgically. The surgery for chronic sinusitis can be: 
- Antral Puncture and Lavage.
- Frontal Sinus Trephination.
- Intranasal Antrostomy.
- Caldwell-Luc Operation.
- External Frontoethmoidectomy
- Osteo-plastic Flap Operation
- External and Internal Ethmoidectomy & Sphenoidectomy

During the decade 1990-2000, there has been a betterment in understanding of anatomy and physiology of parasanal sinuses. 

The correct diagnosis and the extent of the disease is ascertained by CT scan. 

Since the advent of *Hoffkin's Rigid Telescope* and *Computerized Tomography Scan (CT Scan)*, the management of recurrent acute and chronic sinusitis has revolutionized. 

Technological advancements in the field of Fiber-Optics has opened a possibility of avoiding a radical procedure by external route thereby improving the efficiency of the procedure. 

Endoscopic sinus surgery has varied uses, it mainly useful in:

- Nasal polyposis.
- Chronic sinusitis.

It is also useful in other conditions e.g.

- Endoscopic DCR
- Orbital decompression
- Hypophysectomy.
- Choanal Atresia surgery
- Surgery for CSF leak.
- Epestexis diagnosis and treatment.

One of the most promising and newest surgical technique for treatment of Chronic Sinusitis is [Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery ( FESS )](fess.html).
