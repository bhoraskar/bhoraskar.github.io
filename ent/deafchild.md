---

- If one of the children in family was born deaf or if any of the parents have hereditary hearing loss then consult your doctor before planning for a kid. 
- Drugs which are damaging to child's ear (like aspirin, chloroquin, quinine, streptomycin) should be avoided in pregnancy. 

- If there is some viral infection to mother during pregnancy, which may cause deafness in the child, then it is usually better to terminate the pregnancy than to give birth to a deaf child. 
For this reason health of pregnant mother should be carefully monitored during pregnancy and in case of any health problem, specialist lady doctor should be consulted. 

- If some chromosomal abnormality is detected in the fetus (unborn child) then consultation for termination of pregnancy should be seeked. 

- If age of mother is more than 30 years and age of father is more than 35 years then they should consult doctor before planning for a kid. 

- Marriage between close blood relatives should be avoided.
